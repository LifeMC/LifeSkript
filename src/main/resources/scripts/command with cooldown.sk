#
# This script is a template for commands which have a cooldown.
# I will add a more intuitive way of handling cooldowns/countdowns in the future,
# But for now please use something like this.
# Make sure that you do not use delays for cooldowns as they stop when the server stops.
#

# This command allows each player to get infinite cakes
# but the command has a cooldown of one minute (per player)
command /cake:
	description: Recieve a cake, but you can only do this once per minute!
	permission: cake.is_a_lie
	executable by: players
	trigger:
		# stores how long it's been since the player last used this command
		set {_waited} to difference between {cake::%player%::lastused} and now
		# checks whether the player has used the command within the last minute
		if {_waited} is less than a minute:
			message "You have to wait %difference between a minute and {_waited}% before you can use this command again!"
			stop
		
		# some condition which sould not start the cooldown
		# (if the player doesn't get the cake he should be able to use the command again immediately)
		player doesn't have space for a cake:
			message "You do not have enough space in your inventory to hold the cake!"
			stop
			
		# do the action of the command
		give a cake to the player
		
		# and finally start the cooldown
		set {cake::%player%::lastused} to now
