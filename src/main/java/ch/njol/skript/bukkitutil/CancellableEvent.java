/**
 * A shorthand abstract class for using both {@link Event} and {@link Cancellable}
 * for an event.<br /><br />
 * <p>
 * Extending this class makes the event cancellable. You don't need to implement
 * {@link Cancellable#setCancelled(boolean)} and {@link Cancellable#isCancelled()} methods.<br /><br />
 * <p>
 * The cancellation status is stored inside a variable named 'cancelled', which
 * comforts to Java Naming Specification, according to getter and setter names in the interface {@link Cancellable},
 * even though {@link Cancellable#setCancelled(boolean)} defines method parameter name as 'cancel'.<br /><br />
 * <p>
 * The cancellation status variable is private, not protected as expected, also {@link CancellableEvent#setCancelled(boolean)}
 * and {@link CancellableEvent#isCancelled()} methods are final, if you want more customization; implement it yourself, this only a short-hand class.
