/**
 * REM: Don't even think about supporting CraftBukkit's new logging library "log4j". It's probably the worst piece of shi..oftware I have ever seen used.
 * <ul>
 * <li>The interface Logger and its implementation have the same name
 * <li>In general they duplicate existing code from Java (with the same names), but make it worse
 * <li>You can add filters, but it's impossible to remove them
 * <li>It's a miracle that it somehow even logs messages via Java's default logging system, but usually completely ignores it.
 * <li>Because Level is an enum it's not possible to create your own levels, e.g. DEBUG
 * </ul>
