LifeSkript is a plugin for Bukkit/Spigot, which allows server owners and other people to modify servers without learning Java.<br />
It can also be useful if you know Java; some tasks are quicker to do with Skript, and so it can be used for prototyping etc.

Also, Skript is a very easy and understandable domain-specific scripting language, written in plain english sentences. Read the wiki for a great tutorial.

# Server Compatibility
Requirements for running Skript is:
- Java 8 **or later** installed. (Java 8, 11 or 13 is recommended) (Java 8 is highly recommended)
- A Bukkit or Bukkit-based (Bukkit, CraftBukkit, Spigot, PaperSpigot, TacoSpigot, etc.) server to run Skript.
- Minecraft version compatibility is:
  - Tested: 1.7.10 - 1.8.8 (also any version between these) (recommended: TacoSpigot 1.8.8)
  - Can maybe work: 1.2.5 and above (others also maybe work)
- If your server is 1.9 or above, please use Bensku's fork. It's the most updated latest fork of Skript. Get it here: https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript

I've only created this fork for my old 1.7.10 server, so don't expect too much. I will back-port and/or make some sort of bug fixes and features but nothing too much.

# Goals Of This Fork
- Provide bug fixes and backports to older server versions.
- Improve the overall performance of the plugin and scripts.

For more info about performance, see the wiki: [Improving performance](https://github.com/LifeMC/LifeSkript/wiki/Why-the-Skript-Parser-is-so-slow%3F-%5BPerformance-Tips%5D)

# Issues and Pull Requests
Feel free to report all issues, make pull requests, etc. but I can't guarantee these issues will be fixed because I'm not the original
author of the Skript and don't know everything about Skript.
